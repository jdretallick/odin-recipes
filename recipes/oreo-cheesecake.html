        This is a recipe that I found online and then modified to make it less work. 
        If you are a cheesecake person, it is hard to go wrong with this recipe.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>18 oreos (6 for the filling, 12 for the base)</li>
        <li>(375 g) 1.5 cups of cream cheese</li>
        <li>(125 g) 0.5 cups sugar</li>
        <li>(100 ml) 0.3 cups of sour cream</li>
        <li>(15 ml) 1 tbsp of vanilla</li>
        <li> 1 egg (optional)</li>
        <li>(4 g) a pinch of salt if you're feeling devilish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Thaw out the cream cheese and put into a bowl (needs to be soft for 
            mixing)</li>
        <li>Add sugar and sour cream and mix.</li>
        <li>Add vanilla and egg if you so choose. Mix.</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of salt and mix.</li>
        <li>Crush up 6 oreos in your hands (break in quarters if you don't want 
            messy hands). Fold into the rest of the mixture (only mix a bit).</li>
        <li>Lay 12 oreos in a 3x4 pattern on a pan with parchment paper and evenly 
            pour the mixture over it.</li>
        <li>Bake at 275 F for 12 mins to crisp it up a bit. Helps with texture.</li>
    </ol>

        Makes 12 servings. I made these for a work potluck one time and I felt like 
        a meth dealer for my coworkers. Be sure to share them or you will get type 2 
        diabetes.
